# jmangelson DevPod Template

Originally based on [`jusevitch/claude_code_devpod`](https://github.com/jusevitch/claude_code_devpod);
heavily modified by jmangelson for personal workflow needs.

## How it works

The container is built from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` rather than pulling a
plain base image and running a monolithic setup script. Nearly everything is
baked into Docker image layers, so rebuilds only redo work for the layers that
actually changed.

`postCreateCommand` runs only `start-display.sh` -- a lightweight script that
starts the Xvfb/VNC/noVNC daemons when the GUI stack is enabled. It no-ops
instantly otherwise. These must be live processes (can't be baked into an
image), but they start in a few seconds.

### Layer structure

Layers are ordered slowest-to-change -> fastest-to-change. A change to any
layer only invalidates that layer and everything below it.

| # | Contents | Change frequency |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Core system packages: build tools | Rare -- low-level infra only |
| 2 | Node.js + npm global config | Rare -- coupled, always change together |
| 3 | uv + Python 3.12 | Rare -- coupled, always change together |
| 4 | Python venv + Jupyter | Occasional -- add base Python packages here |
| 5 | Claude Code | Occasional |
| 6 | Codex CLI | Occasional -- separate from Claude, independent cadence |
| 7 | LaTeX toolchain (`texlive-latex-extra`, `latexmk`) -- **optional, off by default** | Rare -- only if enabled |
| 8 | GUI stack: Xvfb/x11vnc/noVNC/Chrome -- **optional, off by default** | Rare -- only if enabled |
| 9 | Docker-in-Docker -- **optional, off by default** | Rare -- only if enabled |
| 10 | Android toolchain: JDK, Android SDK/adb, optional emulator, Maestro -- **optional, off by default** | Rare -- only if enabled |
| 11 | Personal apt packages: tmux, vim, emacs, ripgrep, ... | Occasional -- **add new tools here** |
| 12 | Shell config, `.vimrc`, `.bash_aliases` | Frequent |

**Key design decisions:**
Layer 1 is infrastructure that almost never changes (build tools). Node and
npm config are merged (Layer 2) since they're always updated together; same
for uv and Python (Layer 3). The venv is its own layer (Layer 4) so adding
Python packages doesn't re-download Python itself. The optional LaTeX, GUI,
Docker-in-Docker, and Android layers (Layers 7-10) sit before the personal apt
and shell layers. Adding `htop` or `jq` rebuilds Layers 11-12 but leaves
everything above cached.
All apt-install layers use BuildKit cache mounts so `.deb` files are never
re-downloaded from the internet, even on a layer rebuild.

The LaTeX toolchain (Layer 7) is gated behind `ENABLE_LATEX`, the GUI stack
(Layer 8) behind `ENABLE_GUI`, Docker-in-Docker (Layer 9) behind
`ENABLE_DOCKER_IN_DOCKER`, and Android (Layer 10) behind `ENABLE_ANDROID`.
All are skipped by default. The Android emulator and system image are an
additional opt-in controlled by `ENABLE_ANDROID_EMULATOR`. See [Android
development (optional)](#android-development-optional) below to enable it.

**Mounts never trigger a rebuild.** They are container-level config, not part
of the image. Adding or changing a mount only recreates the container (seconds).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [DevPod](https://devpod.sh) installed and configured with a Docker provider
- Docker with BuildKit enabled (default in Docker Desktop and Docker Engine 23+)

### Start the workspace

```bash
devpod up . --ide vscode
```

First run takes 5-10 minutes to build the image. Subsequent starts use the
layer cache and are much faster.

## Adding personal apt packages

Edit **Layer 11** in `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# ── Layer 11: Personal apt packages ──
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt,sharing=locked \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/var/lib/apt,sharing=locked \
    apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        tmux \
        vim \
        emacs \
        ripgrep \
        htop       # ← add new packages here
```

Then rebuild. Only Layer 11 and below rebuild -- Node, Python, Claude, and Codex
all stay cached.

## Enabling the GUI stack

The Chrome/Xvfb/noVNC layer is **off by default**. To enable it for a project:

1. In `devcontainer.json`, uncomment `"ENABLE_GUI": "true"` in `build.args`.
2. Uncomment `containerEnv` and `forwardPorts` further down in the same file.
3. If you'll run this alongside other devpods at the same time, change
   `NOVNC_PORT` (in `containerEnv`) and the matching `forwardPorts` entry to a
   port unique to this project -- devpod forwards the literal port number, so
   two workspaces both left on `6080` will conflict.
4. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   devpod up . --recreate --ide vscode
   ```
   (`--recreate` is required -- `devpod up` reuses an already-running
   container and won't notice the Dockerfile/build-arg change otherwise.)

## Enabling LaTeX

The LaTeX toolchain is **off by default**. To enable it for a project:

1. In `devcontainer.json`, change `"ENABLE_LATEX": "false"` to `"ENABLE_LATEX": "true"` in `build.args`.
2. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   devpod up . --recreate --ide vscode
   ```
   (`--recreate` is required -- `devpod up` reuses an already-running container and will not notice the Dockerfile/build-arg change otherwise.)

This installs `texlive-latex-extra` and `latexmk`, including the standard LaTeX engines and commonly used packages.

## Android development (optional)

The Android layer is intended for an Expo/React Native Android project. It
installs JDK 17 (`JAVA_HOME`, for Gradle) plus a Java 21 runtime (default `java`, for the Firebase emulators), Android SDK command-line tools, `adb`, one Android compile
platform, Android build tools, and Maestro. It does **not** install React or
Expo globally; those belong in the application project and are created with
`npx create-expo-app@latest`.

It also runs `android init` once while building the image. That installs the
Android CLI agent skill for the detected Claude and Codex installations, so the
agent can use the Android-specific workflows without repeating setup at every
container start. The SDK packages are installed with `android sdk install`; the
deprecated `sdkmanager` command is not used.

Enable the Android build toolchain by changing this build arg in
`devcontainer.json`:

```json
"ENABLE_ANDROID": "true"
```

For an autonomous Android emulator that Claude can drive from the container,
also enable the emulator and system image:

```json
"ENABLE_ANDROID_EMULATOR": "true"
```

The `ANDROID_KVM_GID` build arg and matching `--group-add` run arg must match
the host's `/dev/kvm` group ID. This workspace uses `993`; check another host
with `stat -c %g /dev/kvm` and update both values if needed.

An in-container emulator needs host KVM access, not Docker-in-Docker. Uncomment
the Android `runArgs` near `remoteUser`:

```json
"runArgs": ["--device=/dev/kvm", "--group-add=993", "--shm-size=2g"]
```

If Docker-in-Docker is also enabled, combine the arguments into one `runArgs`
entry rather than defining `runArgs` twice:

```json
"runArgs": ["--privileged", "--device=/dev/kvm", "--group-add=993", "--shm-size=2g"]
```

Docker-in-Docker is only needed if the app's development workflow also runs a
containerized backend, database, or integration-test service. It is not needed
to build or test an Android app.

Rebuild after changing the build args:

```bash
devpod up . --recreate --ide vscode
```

DevPod remaps the remote user's UID to match the host user when it creates the
container, which can leave `/opt/android-sdk` owned by the image's build-time
UID. Gradle then fails with "The SDK directory is not writable" when a project
needs an SDK package that isn't preinstalled (React Native auto-installs the
NDK and CMake). `postCreateCommand` runs `fix-android-sdk-owner.sh` to re-own
the SDK for the remote user. To apply it to an existing container without
recreating it:

```bash
bash .devcontainer/fix-android-sdk-owner.sh
```

If the image was already built before the Android skill was added, initialize
the current container once with:

```bash
android init
```

Create and start an emulator inside the container:

```bash
bash .devcontainer/start-emulator.sh
```

The script creates the `devpod-api35` AVD if it doesn't exist, sets its RAM
to 4 GB (`EMULATOR_RAM_MB` overrides it), and cold-boots it detached from the
shell, waiting for boot to finish. It does nothing if an emulator is already
attached. With avdmanager's default 2 GB and a snapshot boot, the emulator's adb
transport repeatedly dropped during Maestro runs; a 4 GB cold boot fixed it
(both were changed together). The AVD lives in
`~/.android/avd/`, not in the image, and `--shm-size=2g` in `runArgs` is
unrelated Docker shared memory.

The existing GUI/noVNC layer is not required for a headless emulator. Enable
it only if you want to watch the emulator visually; automated tests can use
`adb`, Maestro, logs, and screenshots without noVNC.

### Proposed Claude development pipeline

The intended loop is:

1. Claude receives a feature request and edits the Expo/React Native project.
2. Claude runs linting, TypeScript checks, and unit tests.
3. Claude starts Metro with `npx expo start`.
4. Claude builds the native app with `npx expo run:android` when the native
   project or native dependencies change. For JavaScript/TypeScript-only
   changes, Metro/Fast Refresh avoids a full native rebuild.
5. Claude runs Maestro flows in `.maestro/` to launch the app, tap controls,
   enter data, assert visible text, and capture screenshots.
6. Claude reads the test output and iterates until the checks pass.
7. A human reviews the feature on a real Android phone before release.

Typical commands after the first native build are:

```bash
npx expo start
maestro test --test-output-dir=build/maestro-results .maestro
```

For a production release, use EAS Build to create an Android App Bundle for
Google Play or an APK for direct installation. Keep signing credentials and
service tokens outside the repository.

## Enabling Docker-in-Docker

Docker-in-Docker is **off by default**. To enable it for a project:

1. In `devcontainer.json`, change `"ENABLE_DOCKER_IN_DOCKER": "false"` to `"ENABLE_DOCKER_IN_DOCKER": "true"` in `build.args`.
2. Uncomment `"runArgs": ["--privileged"]` near `remoteUser`; the inner Docker daemon requires privileged container access.
3. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   devpod up . --recreate --ide vscode
   ```
4. Start the inner daemon inside the container:
   ```bash
   sudo dockerd --storage-driver=vfs --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock >/tmp/devpod-dockerd.log 2>&1 &
   ```

The Dockerfile installs `docker.io`, which provides both the Docker CLI and daemon. Use the `vfs` storage driver when starting the inner daemon because nested overlay mounts are not supported in the DevPod container environment.

## Adding external folder mounts

Edit the `mounts` array in `devcontainer.json`:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=/your/host/path,target=/workspaces/external/name,type=bind,consistency=cached"
]
```

For example, to mount a Windows-side research folder into the container:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=/mnt/c/Users/mangelson/jgm/work/byu/talks/research/26oceans-sim-workshop,target=/workspaces/external/26oceans-sim,type=bind,consistency=cached"
]
```

The folder will be accessible inside the container at `/workspaces/external/26oceans-sim`. Add as many entries as you need -- each mount is a separate line in the array.

**Read-only mounts:** append `,readonly` to keep the container from writing
back to the host path -- useful for shared reference data or datasets:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=/mnt/c/Users/you/reference-data,target=/workspaces/external/reference-data,type=bind,consistency=cached,readonly"
]
```

**Mixing read-only and read-write:** nest a second mount at a sub-path to make
just that sub-path writable within an otherwise read-only tree -- e.g.
read-only access to a large shared dataset, with read-write on one working
subfolder inside it:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=/mnt/c/Users/you/big-folder,target=/workspaces/external/big-folder,type=bind,consistency=cached,readonly",
    "source=/mnt/c/Users/you/big-folder/subfolder,target=/workspaces/external/big-folder/subfolder,type=bind,consistency=cached"
]
```

Each bind mount is independent at the kernel level, so the more specific
mount simply shadows that portion of the parent -- everything else under
`big-folder` stays read-only.

Then **recreate** (not rebuild) the container:

```bash
devpod up . --recreate --ide vscode
```

Or use the VS Code Command Palette: `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`.
The cached image is reused -- the container is ready in seconds.

## Chrome GUI (noVNC) -- optional

Off by default -- see [Enabling the GUI stack](#enabling-the-gui-stack) above.
Once enabled, the container starts a virtual display (`:99`) with Fluxbox and
exposes it via noVNC on `NOVNC_PORT` (`6080` unless you changed it). Useful
for logging into web interfaces or running Chrome-based sessions inside the
container.

1. DevPod forwards the configured port automatically.
2. Open in a browser (substitute your `NOVNC_PORT` if not the default):
   ```
   http://localhost:6080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=remote
   ```

If you run multiple GUI-enabled devpods at once, give each project a distinct
`NOVNC_PORT` (and matching `forwardPorts` entry) -- devpod forwards the exact
port number, so two workspaces both on `6080` will collide.
